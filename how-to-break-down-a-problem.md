# How to break down a problem
1. Read the problem twice. If the problem is not written down, **write it
   down**.
2. Write out, as comments, the steps that the computer must take to solve the
   problem. Do not leave anything implicit, write it all down. Then go back
   through and make sure it's *all* written down.
3. Change the comments to code, but don't think too far ahead and do the
   simplest thing that could possibly work.
