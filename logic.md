# JavaScript logic
Logic is at the heart of *all* programming.

`true` is not the same as `'true'`

NOT is `!`
AND is `&&`
OR is `||`

If two things must be true to proceed, then `condition1 AND condition2` is the
logical statement you need.

If only one of two things must be true to proceed, then `condition1 OR
condition2` is the logical statement you use.
