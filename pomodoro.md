# Why? (Pomodoro Technique Illustrated)

> Getting thoughts out of your head is mandatory if you want to be able to stay
> focused.

> The prospects for getting into the flow are much better when you are rested,
> seated, and focused than when you are just hanging around and waiting for
> inspiration.

> You will always be doing the thing that matters most and nothing else.

> - Excitement decreases when complexity is high.
> - Procrastination increases when tasks are boring.
> - The pressure builds before a deadline.
> - The hard work is done, but the activities that matter are still not
>   completed.
> - The mental transition between work and breaks is too slow.
> - Mistakes get repeated over and over.
> - The effort that one task takes is underestimated.
> - The scope of a task is underestimated.
> - Your mind is invaded by competing thoughts.
> - A complex and demanding methodology of working consumes your time.
> - You forget about the wholeness while in the flow
> - Estimates are seen as promises.
> - The process is not based on facts.
> - Someone pushes work on you.
> - Perfectionism prevents action.
> - Fear of failure or criticism is a mental impediment.

# The Technique
> It's simple. Choose the highest-priority activity on the To Do Today sheet,
> wind up the clock to 25 minutes, and start focusing on that activity--and only
> that one.

## Tools
- The To Do Today sheet (I use a stack of index cards)
- The Activity Inventory sheet (I use Things.app)
- The Records sheet (Things.app Logbook)

# Stages
## At the start of the day
### Plan
Decide on the day's activities

## Throughout the day
### Track
Track effort and progress.

## At the end of the day
### Record
Compile an archive of daily observations

### Process
Transform raw tracking data into conceptual conclusions.

### Visualize
To present the information in a format that facilitates understanding and clarifies paths to improvement

# The Materials
1. A Pomodoro: a kitchen timer
2. A *To Do Today Sheet*, filled in at the start of each day with the following:
  - A heading with place, date, and author.
  - A list of the things to do during the day, in order of priority
  - A section labelled Unplanned & Urgent Activities where any unexpected tasks that have to be dealt with should be listed as they come up.
3. An *Activity Inventory Sheet*, consisting of:
  - A heading with the name of the author.
  - A number of lines where various activities are noted down as they come up. At the end of the day, the ones that have been completed are checked off.
4. A *Records Sheet*: this is the set of raw data needed to produce pertinent
   reports and graphics. Normally, this sheet would include the date,
   description, and the number of Pomodoros worth of effort needed to accomplish
   a task. This sheet is updated at least once a day, usually at the end of the
   day.

The traditional Pomodoro is 30 minutes long: 25 minutes of work plus a
five-minute break. At the beginning of each day, choose the tasks you want to
tackle from the *Activity Inventory Sheet*, prioritize them, and write them down
in the *To Do Today Sheet*.

When a Pomodoro rings, mark an "X" next to the activity you've been working on
and take a break for 3-5 minutes.

Every four Pomodoros, stop the activity you're working on and take a longer
break, from 15 to 30 minutes.

Keep on working, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, until the task at hand is finished,
and then cross it out on the *To Do Today Sheet*

# Recording
The following boxes may be used on the *Activity Inventory Sheet*
- Date
- Start time
- type of activity
- description
- the actual number of Pomodoros
- notes

# Improvement
How many Pomodoros a week do I spend on work activities and on explorative
activities?
How many Pomodoros do I do on an average day of the week?
Are all the stages in the process effective?

# Interruptions
Every time you feel a potential interruption coming on, put an apostrophe (') on
the sheet where you record your Pomodoros. Then, do one of the following:
- Write down the new activity on the *To Do Today Sheet* under Unplanned &
  Urgent if you think it's imminent and can't be put off.
- Write it down in the Activity Inventory, marking it with a "U" (unplanned);
  add a deadline if need be.
- Intensify your determination to finish the current Pomodoro. Once you've
  marked down the apostrophe, continue working on the given task till the
  Pomodoro rings.

Every time someone or something tries to interrupt a Pomodoro, put a dash on the
sheet where you record your Pomodoros. Then:
- Write down the new activity on the *To Do Today Sheet* under Unplanned &
  Urgent if you think it's imminent and can't be put off, adding the promised
  deadline in brackets in the left hand margin.
- Write it down in the Activity Inventory, marking it with a "U" (unplanned);
  add a deadline if need be.
- Intensify your determination to finish the current Pomodoro. Once you've
  marked down the apostrophe, continue working on the given task till the
  Pomodoro rings.
  
# Estimate the Effort for Activities
At the start of each day, estimate how many Pomodoros each activity in the *Inventory* will take. Revise previous estimates, if needed. Record the estimated number of Pomodoros on the relative line.
